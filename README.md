# KO-Bugda
https://www.kobugda.com

I decided to extract some important parts of the code to be available for others so you can eventually build your own site. 
In this way, there is a chance that KO players will still have some up to date site - yes, I am not maintaining KObugda anymore, just keeping it alive. 

My code is quite terrible and that's reason why I show only specific parts. If you will want show some specific part, you can contact me (probably best way is through Steam KO Discord - you can tag me there and I'll eventually open PMs)
