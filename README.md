# KO-Bugda
https://www.kobugda.com

I decided to extract some important parts of the code to be available for others so you can eventually build your own site. 
In this way, there is a chance that KO players will still have some up to date site - yes, I am not maintaining KObugda anymore, just keeping it alive.
